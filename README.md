## Notes

You can do with this tool what you want as the licence says if you add any features to it i would appreciate if you would share your code so that everyone can benefit from it.

I recommend if you use it on your own server to merge this tool with your other mods (if there licence allows it) and create one big server mod for compatibility.

It is probably bad written.

It can be done better.

It has surely bugs i dont know of.

There will be someone who creates an actuall good Admin Tool.

Meanwhile i am Listening to suggestions 
and fixing the known bugs if i can .

You could cantact me per mail at DayZ-SA-Tomato@Primary-Network.de
